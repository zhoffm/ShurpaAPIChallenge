Api to interface with code_challenge.html

Used Flask for a basic web server, Flask-RESTful for an easy to set up API, and Flask-CORS in order for Firefox to correctly send data to the server.

To install necessary requirements do:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To start server, just run app.py like a normal python script.

```
python app.py
```
